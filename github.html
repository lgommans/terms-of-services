<a id="the-github-terms-of-service" class="anchor" href="#the-github-terms-of-service" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The GitHub Terms of Service</h3>

<p>Effective date: <strong>DRAFT — NOT YET EFFECTIVE</strong></p>

<h3>
<a id="a-definitions" class="anchor" href="#a-definitions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A. Definitions</h3>

<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at <a href="https://github.com/site/privacy">github.com/site/privacy</a>) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at <a href="/categories/site-policy/">help.github.com/categories/site-policy</a>.</li>
<li>The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub.</li>
<li>The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as <a href="https://education.github.com/">education.github.com</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">pages.github.com</a>. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as <a href="https://CodeConf.com/">CodeConf.com</a> and product websites, such as <a href="https://atom.io/">atom.io</a>. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.</li>
<li>“The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See <a href="#4-additional-terms">Section B(4): Additional Terms</a>).</li>
<li>“GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.</li>
<li>“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. “Paid Content” is Content only available to Users who are participating in a payment plan, including private repositories.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="b-account-terms" class="anchor" href="#b-account-terms" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>B. Account Terms</h3>

<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. Your are responsible for keeping your account secure.</em></p>

<h4>
<a id="1-required-information" class="anchor" href="#1-required-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Required Information</h4>

<p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a <a href="#j-payment">paid account</a>, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p>

<h4>
<a id="2-account-requirements" class="anchor" href="#2-account-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. Account Requirements</h4>

<p>We have a few simple rules for accounts on GitHub's Service.</p>

<ul>
<li>You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:<br>
</li>
<li>A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.</li>
<li>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).</li>
<li>You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will <a href="#k-cancellation-and-termination">terminate that User’s account immediately</a>. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.</li>
<li>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows.</li>
<li>Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you've ordered from us.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="3-user-account-security" class="anchor" href="#3-user-account-security" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. User Account Security</h4>

<p>You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your account's security, but the content of your account and its security are up to you.</p>

<ul>
<li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).</li>
<li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
<li>You will promptly notify GitHub if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="4-additional-terms" class="anchor" href="#4-additional-terms" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4. Additional Terms</h4>

<p>In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.</p>

<p>If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this <a href="/articles/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-u-s-federal-government-users/">Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service</a> applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.</p>

<p>If you are an owner or administrator of an Organization on GitHub, additional terms may govern your relationship with us and supersede this Agreement.</p>

<h3>
<a id="c-acceptable-use" class="anchor" href="#c-acceptable-use" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>C. Acceptable Use</h3>

<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.</em></p>

<h4>

<li>attempt to disrupt or tamper with GitHub's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on GitHub's servers through automated means, or to access GitHub's Service in ways that exceed your authorization (other than those authorized by the <a href="https://bounty.github.com/">GitHub Bug Bounty program</a>);</li>
<li>impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with GitHub, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or</li>

</ul>

<p>It is prohibited to scrape GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.</p>

<h4>

<p>Misuse of GitHub Users' Personal Information is prohibited.</p>

<p>Any person, entity, or service collecting data from GitHub must comply with the <a href="https://github.com/site/privacy">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If you collect any GitHub User's Personal Information from GitHub, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from GitHub or GitHub Users.</p>

<h4>
<a id="7-excessive-bandwidth-use" class="anchor" href="#7-excessive-bandwidth-use" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>7. Excessive Bandwidth Use</h4>

<p>If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other GitHub customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.</p>

<h4>
<a id="8-user-protection" class="anchor" href="#8-user-protection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>8. User Protection</h4>

<h3>
<a id="d-user-generated-content" class="anchor" href="#d-user-generated-content" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>D. User-Generated Content</h3>

<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service — we need the right to do things like reproduce your content (so we can do things like copy it to our database and make backups); display it (so we can do things like show it to you and other users); modify it (so our server can do things like translate it to machine language); distribute it (so we can do things like share it with other users); and perform it (in case your content is something like music or video). We have the right to remove content or close accounts if we need to.</em></p>

<h4>
<a id="1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content" class="anchor" href="#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</h4>

<p>You may create User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.</p>

<h4>
<a id="2-ownership-of-content-and-right-to-post" class="anchor" href="#2-ownership-of-content-and-right-to-post" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. Ownership of Content and Right to Post</h4>

<p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself, you agree that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post, and you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.</p>

<h4>
<a id="3-github-may-remove-content" class="anchor" href="#3-github-may-remove-content" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. GitHub May Remove Content</h4>

<p>We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any GitHub terms or policies.</p>

<h4>
<a id="4-license-grant-to-us" class="anchor" href="#4-license-grant-to-us" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4. License Grant to Us</h4>

<p>Your Content belongs to you, and you are responsible for Content you post even if it does not belong to you. However, we need the legal right to do things like host it, publish it, and share it. Solely to allow us to provide the Service and to host the Content you upload to the Website without violating any rights you have in it, you grant GitHub and our successors a nonexclusive, worldwide, transferable, fully-paid and royalty-free license to use, reproduce, display, modify, adapt, distribute, and perform the Content in connection with rendering the Website and providing the Service. This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell your Content or otherwise distribute it outside of our Service.</p>

<h4>
<a id="5-license-grant-to-other-users" class="anchor" href="#5-license-grant-to-other-users" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5. License Grant to Other Users</h4>

<p>Any Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of your content in repositories they control).</p>

<p>If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you hereby grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to access your Content through the GitHub Service, and to use, display and perform your Content, and to reproduce your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality. You may grant further rights if you <a href="/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository">adopt a license</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, unless there is a Contributor License Agreement to the contrary, whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms.</p>

<h4>
<a id="6-moral-rights" class="anchor" href="#6-moral-rights" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>6. Moral Rights</h4>

<p>You retain all moral rights to Content you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D, but not otherwise. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in this Section.</p>

<p>To the extent such an agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub a nonexclusive, revocable, worldwide, royalty-free right to (1) use the Content without attribution; and (2) make reasonable adaptations of the Content as provided in this Section.</p>

<h4>
<a id="7-private-repositories" class="anchor" href="#7-private-repositories" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>7. Private Repositories</h4>

<p>Paid accounts may have <a href="/articles/making-a-public-repository-private/">private repositories</a>, which allow the User to control access to Content. GitHub employees <a href="/articles/github-security/#employee-access">do not access private repositories unless required to</a> for security or maintenance, or for support reasons, with the consent of the repository owner. Because we respect your privacy in private repositories, you must respect the Terms of Service in everything you post to a private repository. If we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to remove them.</p>

<a id="e-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy" class="anchor" href="#e-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>E. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h3>
