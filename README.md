This repository is a collection of terms of services. When they get updated, I
update the file, and Github can nicely display a "diff" (highlight differences).

I just started this since I was disappointed in Github's ToS update not being
presented as a git commit. In the future I might just copy-paste any ToS in here
that I ever agree to, because I remember past events where I got an email "our ToS
is updated" with no way back and sometimes not even an archived copy on The
Internet Archive. And if they provide a "what's new" section, it usually just
highlights good or irrelevant parts, or mention things like "we made it easier
for you to read!" which are good but probably not the whole truth.
