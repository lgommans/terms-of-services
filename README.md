# ToSes

This repository is a collection of terms of services. When they get updated, I
update the file, and Github can nicely display a "diff" (highlight differences).

## Why

I just started this since I was disappointed in Github's ToS update not being
presented as a git commit. In the future I might just copy-paste any ToS in here
that I ever agree to, because I remember past events where I got an email "our ToS
is updated" with no way back and sometimes not even an archived copy on The
Internet Archive. And if they provide a "what's new" section, it usually just
highlights good or irrelevant parts, or mention things like "we made it easier
for you to read!" which are good but probably not the whole truth.

## Contributing

Feel free to pull request any new ToS'es or updates!

If you want to improve an existing ToS' readability, please commit your changes
into a new file, e.g. [service-name]-v2.txt.

## Terms of Services in this repository

- Github.com as html and as txt, where txt is just a copy-paste out of Firefox.
